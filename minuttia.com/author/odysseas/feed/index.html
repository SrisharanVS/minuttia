										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a University from Arizona, humans speak on average </span><b>16,000 words</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you’re a teacher or frequent public speaker, that’s a lot!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority of those words take place during conversations with other people, with each conversation covering a</span><b> certain topic</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are, you’ve found yourself in the place of not being able to make exact sense of what topic a conversation was all about, because its contents (words) didn’t clearly point to it, in what might have caused you confusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search engines work in a similar way, because their algorithms need to be provided with the right terms in order to associate them with each other and have enough context, as to what the </span><b>main topic</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can imagine, this can cause many problems in terms of SEO performance, so let’s see how you can avoid them.</span></p>

<p>For some time now, we’re thinking about the <strong>right number of items</strong> to include in a list post. </p>



<p>Should we include as many items as possible so that we satisfy those who want as many options as possible while evaluating solutions based on a given topic or problem they have? Maybe we should include as few items as possible to satisfy those who want as few options as possible? Should we even follow what Google’s top search results are doing?</p>



<p>The answer, as it turns out, is a bit more complicated and yet simple at the same time. To know how many items you should include in a list post, you should know <strong>the type of person</strong> you’re creating the post for. </p>



<p>Sounds interesting? Let’s get into it and, hopefully, by the end of this post you’ll know how many items you should include in your list post, based on whether you’re creating content for a maximizer or a satisficer.</p>
