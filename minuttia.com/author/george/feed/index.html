										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How do you usually formulate your emails?</p>
<p>We bet most of you don’t shy away from lengthy explanations and details to be as specific about the topic as possible.</p>
<p>But if you send such an email to Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, he will get mad.</p>
<p>At least that’s what former Nvidia employees told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-jensen-huang-email-style-concise-key-points-insiders-2024-5">Business Insider</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, Jensen follows a very concise approach to email writing and demands the same from his co-workers.</p>
<p>What is this approach?</p>
<p>We’ve studied it front to back and masterminded a framework you can apply to your content processes, too.</p>
<p>But before we dive into that, we need to explore Nvidia’s organizational structure and how it impacts internal communication.</p>

<p>It was more like a template with the ability to add basic recommendations on a page level when auditing content (redirect, update, delete, etc.).</p>
<p>Since then, we&#8217;ve audited thousands of content pieces, shared thousands of recommendations on a page and content inventory level with our clients, and figured out what works and what doesn&#8217;t work when it comes to content.</p>
<p>During these experiences, we completely updated our processes and developed tools and proprietary methodologies that have a single goal:</p>
<p>To connect <strong>content performance to revenue generation</strong>.</p>
<p>Enter: Content Audit 2.0.</p>
<p>In this guide, I’ll walk you through our process and explain what Content Audit 2.0 is all about.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what happened with a domain I bought ~4 years ago.</p>
<p>The goal?</p>
<p>Launch a newsletter on B2B growth and marketing, sharing exclusive insights from my personal journey.</p>
<p>These wouldn&#8217;t be the same insights I discuss elsewhere, online or offline.</p>
<p>Yes, I might be a bit late in joining the newsletter bandwagon and, admittedly, I did procrastinate.</p>
<p>But life happens, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Our priorities shift, goals evolve and, sometimes, we simply lack the bandwidth to chase every dream simultaneously.</p>
<p>Yet, the time feels right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four years ago, in June of 2019, I published a <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/how-close-are-we-to-a-new-dot-com-bubble-92605fab1b32">Medium post</a> on HackerNoon.</p>
<p>In that post, I outlined an uncomfortable reality:</p>
<p>The tech industry was (once again) growing too fast, and many of the things we were experiencing, well, didn’t seem very normal.</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<p>This was a few months before the Covid-19 pandemic took the world by storm and completely changed our definition of what’s normal.</p>
<p>The slowdown due to Covid was followed by an even more euphoric period for many tech companies with valuations <a href="https://a16z.com/2022/05/13/a-framework-for-navigating-down-markets-2/">up to 25x revenue multiples</a>, absurdly high funding rounds, and a hiring frenzy like very few in the history of tech.</p>
<p>Of course, this new “dot-com bubble” (as per my Medium post) wasn’t (nor isn’t) the only reason why we reached the point we’re at today.</p>
<p>And what is that point?</p>
<p>It’s called a recession.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be afraid to say it.</p>
<p>After all, the only way to start overcoming something is to accept it.</p>
<p>This post isn’t a financial analysis or an effort to make you feel good about yourself and the future.</p>
<p>At Minuttia, we’re transparent and honest even when it hurts (or even when it’s not in our best interest to do so).</p>
<p>This post is a way to help you accept the reality we’re in, straighten up your shoulders, and act confidently with the help of a plan that is both practical and actionable.</p>
<p>Let’s get into it.</p>

<p>The goal was simple:</p>
<p>To become one of the most respected and trusted content marketing agencies in the world, specifically for SaaS companies.</p>
<p>Even though many things have changed in these three years, our initial goal remains the same.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, we understood that our assumptions as to what the SaaS industry (which we proudly serve) needs weren’t exactly right.</p>
<p>One of these assumptions was that design is something companies are very bullish about—having strong convictions and opinions on the subject—and generally don’t need as it’s covered in-house.</p>
<p>We were wrong.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll explain why our assumptions were wrong and why the SaaS industry calls for great design, integrated with our knowledge and expertise in content marketing and SEO.</p>

<p>So, the plan was that I was going to build a system around what I had learned and knew best and scale it up. Little did I know what actually goes into building your own company and scaling up your time and expertise, which in most professional services is your product.</p>
<p>As difficult as it may have been, the journey was (and still is) very rewarding. In this post, I will explain how we got started, what led us here, and why changing our brand identity at the stage we’re at wasn’t an option but a necessity. Let’s begin.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one really thought about coming up with something </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">entirely different</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until Benz became the first to experiment with a new idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, as Henry Ford said: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would&#8217;ve said faster horses.” </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the concept of not focusing on what people want and trying to satisfy their existing needs but creating new needs yourself by inventing innovative approaches, products, or ways of thinking and doing things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This innovative and unorthodox way of thinking can also be applied to SEO.</span></p>
