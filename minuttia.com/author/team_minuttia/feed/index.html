<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is every single tool used necessary for growth? The answer is most likely no, but when it comes to </span><b>project management tools</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they can be of vital importance for teams, especially remote working ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great example of such a tool is </span><a href="https://clickup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ClickUp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; an all-in-one app for teams to increase their productivity through a wide range of handy features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the company itself states:</span><br />
<div class="article-quote-wrapper"><div class="article-quote-text">One app to replace them all.</div></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the vision that ClickUp’s founder, Zeb Evans, has is quite clear!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our second post of this series, we’re going to break down how ClickUp has managed to reach such impressive </span><b>organic growth stats</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and achieve a 200% increase in organic traffic in two years.</span><br />

<p>This isn’t another beginner’s guide on how to choose the right keywords for your content and SEO strategy. We’ve created this guide as part of the change we&#8217;ve applied to the way we think about the value of keywords and <strong>how we make decisions at scale</strong> for our clients after conducting keyword research.</p>



<p>Thus, if you’re really interested in diving deeper into the very fundamentals of keyword selection and you want to change the way you’re doing things, this guide is for you. </p>



<p>When we say <em>keywords</em>, essentially we mean the terms that you can get through keyword data providers such as Ahrefs or SEMrush. We don’t endorse the use of the word keywords, rather use it for practical purposes, just so we have a common understanding of the things we’re about to describe. </p>



<p>Now that we have the stage set, let’s begin with what’s wrong with keyword selection in the current climate. </p>

<p>Let’s face it: SEO isn’t for everyone. There are several cases where SEO can’t &#8211; and shouldn’t &#8211; be used as a growth lever for a SaaS company. The space of online video editing isn’t one of these cases. A relative newcomer in that category that <a href="https://www.veed.io/blog/startup-growth-no-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has experienced exponential growth</a> over the last two years, Veed.io, is a shining example of that.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.veed.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Veed.io</a> is an online video editing software that allows you to do pretty much everything you need in terms of online video creation and editing. Having followed one of the company’s co-founders, Sabba Keynejad, since the early days of their journey, we&#8217;ve been impressed with Veed’s growth, not only in terms of revenue and number of customers, but also in terms of their organic growth.</p>



<p>In our first post of this new series, we’re going to try to break down how Veed.io managed to achieve frankly astounding levels of organic growth in such a short amount of time. Let’s get into it. </p>
