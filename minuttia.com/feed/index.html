										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How do you usually formulate your emails?</p>
<p>We bet most of you don’t shy away from lengthy explanations and details to be as specific about the topic as possible.</p>
<p>But if you send such an email to Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, he will get mad.</p>
<p>At least that’s what former Nvidia employees told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-jensen-huang-email-style-concise-key-points-insiders-2024-5">Business Insider</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, Jensen follows a very concise approach to email writing and demands the same from his co-workers.</p>
<p>What is this approach?</p>
<p>We’ve studied it front to back and masterminded a framework you can apply to your content processes, too.</p>
<p>But before we dive into that, we need to explore Nvidia’s organizational structure and how it impacts internal communication.</p>
